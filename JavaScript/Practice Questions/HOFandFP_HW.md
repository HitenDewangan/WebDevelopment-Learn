1. Explain the difference between **_forEach, map, filter, and reduce_**.
2. Define a callback function before you use it in forEach, map, filter or reduce.
3. Use **_forEach_** to console.log each country in the countries array.
4. Use **_forEach_** to console.log each name in the names array.
5. Use **_forEach_** to console.log each number in the numbers array.
6. Use **_map_** to create a new array by changing each country to uppercase in the countries array.
7. Use **_map_** to create an array of countries length from countries array.
8. Use **_map_** to create a new array by changing each number to square in the numbers array
9. Use **_map_** to change to each name to uppercase in the names array
10. Use **_map_** to map the products array to its corresponding prices.
11. Use **_filter_** to filter out countries containing **_land_**.
12. Use **_filter_** to filter out countries having six character.
13. Use **_filter_** to filter out countries containing six letters and more in the country array.
14. Use **_filter_** to filter out country start with 'E';
15. Use **_filter_** to filter out only prices with values.
16. Declare a function called getStringLists which takes an array as a parameter and then returns an array only with string items.
17. Use **_reduce_** to sum all the numbers in the numbers array.
18. Use **_reduce_** to concatenate all the countries and to produce this sentence: **_Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and IceLand are north European countries_**
19. Explain the difference between **_some_** and **_every_**

23. Use **_find_** to find the first country containing only six letters in the countries array
24. Use **_findIndex_** to find the position of the first country containing only six letters in the countries array
25. Use **_findIndex_** to find the position of **_Norway_** if it doesn't exist in the array you will get -1.
26. Use **_findIndex_** to find the position of **_Russia_** if it doesn't exist in the array you will get -1.

### Exercises: Level 2

1. Find the total price of products by chaining two or more array iterators(eg. arr.map(callback).filter(callback).reduce(callback))
1. Find the sum of price of products using only reduce reduce(callback))
1. Declare a function called **_categorizeCountries_** which returns an array of countries which have some common pattern(you find the countries array in this repository as countries.js(eg 'land', 'ia', 'island','stan')).
1. Create a function which return an array of objects, which is the letter and the number of times the letter use to start with a name of a country.

### Exercises: Level 3

1. Use the countries information, in the data folder. Sort countries by name, by capital, by population
1. Find the 10 most spoken languages:

   ````js
   // Your output should look like this
   console.log(mostSpokenLanguages(countries, 10))
   [
   {country: 'English',count:91},
   {country: 'French',count:45},
   {country: 'Arabic',count:25},
   {country: 'Spanish',count:24},
   {country:'Russian',count:9},
   {country:'Portuguese', count:9},
   {country:'Dutch',count:8},
   {country:'German',count:7},
   {country:'Chinese',count:5},
   {country:'Swahili',count:4}
   ]

   // Your output should look like this
   console.log(mostSpokenLanguages(countries, 3))
   [
   {country: 'English',count: 91},
   {country: 'French',count: 45},
   {country: 'Arabic',count: 25},
   ]```

   ````

1. Use countries_data.js file create a function which create the ten most populated countries

   ````js
   console.log(mostPopulatedCountries(countries, 10))

   [
   {country: 'China', population: 1377422166},
   {country: 'India', population: 1295210000},
   {country: 'United States of America', population: 323947000},
   {country: 'Indonesia', population: 258705000},
   {country: 'Brazil', population: 206135893},
   {country: 'Pakistan', population: 194125062},
   {country: 'Nigeria', population: 186988000},
   {country: 'Bangladesh', population: 161006790},
   {country: 'Russian Federation', population: 146599183},
   {country: 'Japan', population: 126960000}
   ]

   console.log(mostPopulatedCountries(countries, 3))
   [
   {country: 'China', population: 1377422166},
   {country: 'India', population: 1295210000},
   {country: 'United States of America', population: 323947000}
   ]
